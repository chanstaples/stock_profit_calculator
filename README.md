# Install Python 3.9.5
This program requires Python 3 to execute correctly. Downloading the latest version (3.9.5) is highly recommended. This process is not automated or included in the program, it must be completed individually by user. Here is a great website that provides instructions on how to install Python regardless of operating system: https://realpython.com/installing-python/.

# Initial Setup of Program
Download the program by selecting the green button 'Code' and selecting 'Download ZIP' from the dropdown menu. After downloading is completed, unzip the program. The unzip location does not matter, this is truly up to the user. After unzipping, the user will run one of the two scripts based on their operating system. 
For Windows users, please navigate to the program directory and double click the windows_setup file or in the Command Prompt, navigate to the program's unzipped directory and type "windows_setup.bat" without the quotation marks. You will see another Command Prompt briefly appear and disappear.
For Linux/Unix users, the process is fairly similar. After navigating to the program directory, please click linux_unix_setup or from the Command Line, navigate to the unzipped program directory and type "./linux_unix_setup.sh" without including the quotation marks. 
These 2 files install automatically the packages required to run this program and that is all. No funny business, just some quick automation.

From the Command Prompt, navigate to the program directory. To run the program, type "python3 s
For Linux/Unix users, it is recommended to use the Command Line.
